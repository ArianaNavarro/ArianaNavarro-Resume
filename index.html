        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ariana Navarro and I am a first generation college student at the University of California, Riverside. In high school, I volunteered for a program called Best Buddies which was a program so that students in general education and special education can interact with each other. I was in this program for 4 years because I loved being there for a community that society has often ignored. I was also in the Academy of Arts and Communication Technologies where I had the opportunity to learn editing skills and photography. Last year, I was a teacherâ€™s assistant for Leslie Bohn at Cajon High School where I handled tasks such as grading,  inserting them into the gradebook, and many more different tasks. I am currently working on opening up a small business for metaphysical items such as crystals and necklaces in order to provide the people of Southern California with unique metaphysical items.<br><br>
